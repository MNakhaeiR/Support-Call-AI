# Project Name

## Overview
This project is designed to capture audio, analyze it for various parameters such as sentiment, emotion, and stress levels, and provide a graphical user interface for user interaction. It utilizes advanced machine learning models for speech recognition and analysis.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the environment:
   ```
